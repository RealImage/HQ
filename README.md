# HQ

### A PaaS controller for AWS that encapsulates best practices

HQ runs on only on your local machine, talking directly to AWS with no intermediate network calls. The source is MIT License and fully auditable. 

Heavily inspired by 

https://github.com/convox/rack
https://github.com/remind101/empire

Both are great options if you want a command line interface, but HQ provides a much simpler, more opinionated model of deploying 12 factor applicatons.
